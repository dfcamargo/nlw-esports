# NLW E-Sports

Final NLW project promoted by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/). 
The challenge was to develop a gamer connect platform. The players post ads with base information about your favorite game, about your playing time, 
and your Discord to connect with other players at the time of their match.

The project is divided into 3 stacks. Each one with their own responsibility:

- **Server:** API for controlling and managing data and business rules.
- **Web:** Web layer for publishing new ads.
- **Mobile:** Mobile layer to find out ads and connect with players.

# Let's start!

Clone the project:
```
git@github.com:dfcamargo/nlw-esports.git
```
Install the dependences for each layer following their own documentation.

Enjoy!
